changes:
  - tweak: Dwarves now enter a metabolic frenzy when above 400 alchohol. This triggers
      their regen and rapidly increases body temp. When body temp gets too high, they
      start taking heavy burn damage. Ride the lightning!
  - tweak: Dwarf alchohol level now rapidly decreases when above 400.
  - tweak: Dwarf speed is 10% higher.
  - tweak: better dwarf names.
  - tweak: Dwarves no longer starve to death while ssd.
  - tweak: Dwarves now slur their words with much lower intensity while drunk.
  - balance: Dwarves now gain nutrition when very hungry and drunk.
  - balance: Dwarves now take 50% more stamina damage, and have 30% longer stuns
  - balance: Dwarf regen power greatly reduced.
  - balance: Dwarf 0-alchohol damage greatly reduced. Instead, they now rapidly lose
      nutriment, take stam damage, and randomly get blurred vision. Fun!
  - tweak: alcohol now affects the power of dwarf regen slightly, based on drink quality.
  - code_imp: adds a stamina mod to species.
