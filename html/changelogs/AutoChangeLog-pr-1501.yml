changes:
  - rscadd: Elzuosa resprite by any%! Everyone's favorite crystal plant furries now
      have a proper look! Make sure to adjust any current elzu characters you have,
      as this adds a lot of customization.
  - rscadd: Elzu now have horns and tails that can be changed; horn sprites by any%
      and tail sprites by Recoherent.
  - tweak: Elzu are no longer restricted to an arbitrary set of colors, and can be
      set to whatever you desire, so long as it isn't too dark; this still works with
      multitools and emags.
  - tweak: Elzu glow has been toned down significantly, and is no longer eye-searing.
  - tweak: Elzu can now have their eye color changed independently of their base color.
  - tweak: Elzu no longer have the agender trait; feel free to keep them on Other
      if you still want gender-neutral pronouns, but the other options are fully available.
