  - tweak: internals connection will persist for a moment after you take your breathing
      apparatus off
  - bugfix: taking off any mask-slot item while you have an internals-flagged helmet
      on no longer shuts off your internals
  - bugfix: turning on your internals will no longer scrungle your headbandana
  - bugfix: bubbleblowers and smokers will no longer have their internals shut off
      when they run out of bubblegum or smokes
